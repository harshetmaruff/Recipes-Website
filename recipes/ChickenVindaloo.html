            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 large potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Let's Cook</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir spices constantly as they toast to ensure they do not burn.</li>
            <li>Stir in onion, olive oil, garlic, and ginger. Increase heat to medium; cook and stir until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste until no lumps of paste remain. Add chicken, potatoes, tomatoes, broth, wine vinegar, and bay leaf; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover and continue cooking until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt, black pepper, and additional cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
